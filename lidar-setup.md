## Required hardware components
- Hokuyo UST-10LX 2D LiDAR sensor
- NVIDIA Jetson TX2 Developer Kit
- 12V Power supply for LiDAR

## NVIDIA Jetson TX2 Software
- Power Jetson TX2 carrier board using the included power supply
- Install the recommended Ubuntu 18.04
- Install Robot Operating System (ROS) Melodic, and the `ros-melodic-driver-base` package using `apt`

## Hokuyo LiDAR sensor connection
- Strip the brown (DC in) and blue (ground) wires from the LiDAR 5-pin connector and power them using a wall adapter or suitable power supply. Below is a temporary jank example using a 12V barrel plug. Be very careful to get the positive and ground connections right.

- Configure the TX2 eth0 interface as follows:
  ```
  auto eth0
  iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.0.15
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.0.1
  ```
- Save the IP address of the Hokuyo device to an environment variable
  ```
  export HOKUYO_DEV=192.168.0.10
  ```
- Connect the ethernet cable to the TX2 board and connect the eth0 interface. Make sure that the lidar is reachable
  ```
  ping $HOKUYO_DEV
  ```

## Visual LiDAR Test
- Install the [urg_node](http://wiki.ros.org/urg_node) ROS package
- Execute `roscore`
- From another terminal window, start the `urg_node` for the Hokuyo device
  ```
  rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:=$HOKUYO_DEV
  ```
- From another terminal window, check that the sensor data from the Hokuyo LiDAR is being published to the `/scan` topic
  ```
  rostopic echo /scanâ€‹
  ```
- If that works, start the `rviz` node
  ```
  rosrun rviz rviz
  ```
- In the rviz application, modify the `Fixed Frame` entry to "laser", then add a new display by topic using the "/scan" topic. It should look like the following:
