# Power Delivery

All components of the vehicle are powered by a Traxxas 5000mAh 3S 11.1V LiPo Battery Pack. __Be very careful when handling the LiPo battery. Never plug it in the wrong way or leave it plugged in while unattended.__

The battery directly powers the Velineon VXL-3s electronic speed controller (ESC). An additional 2.1mm barrel plug to a power board that distributes power to the other devices. This power board is controlled by a switch protruding from the rear segment of the shell on which it is mounted.

It is important to note that both the ESC and the power board must be switched off to prevent the battery from discharging. Though it is recommended to unplug the battery as well when the vehicle is not in use.

Only the ESC is necessary to control the car manually with the included RC joystick. However, the throttle and steering ribbon cables must be connected to the labeled ribbon cables protruding from the radio receiver box between the ESC and the radio antenna.
